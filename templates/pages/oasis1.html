        Does virtual reality need a headset?

    <p>
        Oasis is a virtual gallery for terminal and textual works contained within a raspberry pi only accessible by SSH.
        You can visit <a href="http://oasisvr.info">http://oasisvr.info</a> for instructions on
        how to travel to oasis (it's currently in a corner of my apartment).
    </p>

    <p>
        For <a href="http://radicalnetworks.org">Radical Networks</a>
        I also created a physical installation allowing visitors to explore Oasis directly through a screen and keyboard.
    </p>

    <p>
        On Oasis there are folders (like any other file system), but instead of "Pictures", "Work", "Memes",
        the folders on Oasis have names resembling the rooms of a house.
    </p>
    <p>
        Visitors are presented with a greetingroom, as well as an attic, basement and garden (etc.) which they can move through and explore
        using the command line.
    </p>
    <p>
        The pi is publicly accessible through the internet by SSH (instructions can be found here <a href="http://oasisvr.info">oasisvr.info</a>)
        so a community across the world can interact in this 'place'.
    </p>
    <p>
        In July of 2016 I tweeted out a link to a site explaining how to access the pi, and around 30 people SSHed into the pi and explored,
        having conversations with each other through ytalk,
        and adding additional folders and files extending the imagined world which I had begun.
        Most of the files and folders currently on the pi were created by visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the SFPC final show, I also created a gallery folder on the pi
        where I collaborated with my classmates to make terminal based art
        which can be experienced through SSH (in this folder you can find 6 pieces which use terminal in different ways).

    <p>
        In the past whenever I would use SSH to work on a remote
        server I noticed a feeling which resembled the presence I feel while using a Virtual Reality headset system.
    </p>
    <p>
        With oasis I tried to take this feeling to its extreme and explore what constitutes a sensation of space &mdash;
        does virtual reality need three visual dimensions,
        or can the folder structure of an internet connected raspberry pi actually become an immersive virtual world?
