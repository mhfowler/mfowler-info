    <h2>TI-89 & The Poetics Of Space</h2>

    <p>
        There is a popular way of understanding the world, as a collection of particles interacting based
        on physical laws, which leads many to the conclusion that there is no such thing as "free will",
        something a great many people have got hung up about in textbooks, ethical manifestos,
        and at diners at 3am trying to make sense of all this stardust.
    </p>
    <!--<p>-->
    <!--This train of thought can-->
    <!--help bring out some good things (letting go of regrets, self-acceptance,-->
    <!--radical empathy), but perhaps the question of "free will" in the sense of how to find or create the mental fortitude-->
    <!--to make the decisions we should is more urgent than the quasi-metaphysical question of-->
    <!--what causes those decisions in "Me".-->
    <!--</p>-->

        Perhaps the question of "free will" in the sense of how to find or create the mental fortitude
        to make the decisions we should is more urgent than the quasi-metaphysical question of
        what causes those decisions in "Me".
    </p>

    <p>
        Some dogmatic determinists seem to want to replace any notion of a person with a set
        of gravitational equations which may have already been solved somewhere
        in a middle school classroom in rural arkansas by a precocious algebra student doing
        some extra-curricular work on their TI-89.
