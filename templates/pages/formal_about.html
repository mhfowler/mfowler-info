            Some of my recent projects have explored the ways that we conceptualize space, expressive analysis of text message history and how to use a twitter bot to take out the trash.
        <p>
            I'm interested in using data visualization to explore subjectivity, generative poetry,
            and the ways we use technology to decide what to read.
