    <p>
        in the introduction Bachelard is generally arguing that good poetry involves novel creation (what he calls sublimation) â€” that in the poem there is something there which was not there before
    </p>

    <p>
        the psycho-analyst on the other hand analyzes the poem in terms of the poet's past... what happened to them as a child and how that caused them to write the poem etc.
    </p>

    <p>
        Bachelard's latin quote here is pretty much just a zinger, he's saying if the psycho-analyst is interested the original causes of things, he should just stay in the womb
